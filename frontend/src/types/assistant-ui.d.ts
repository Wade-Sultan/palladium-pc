/**
 * Custom assistant-transport commands.
 *
 * assistant-ui's command vocabulary is `add-message` and `add-tool-result`,
 * extended through this augmentation point. Declaring `select-case` here is
 * what lets the case picker's click ride an ordinary /chat request instead of
 * a side channel of its own, so a pick reuses the whole turn machinery
 * (worker dispatch, the Valkey event stream, resume-on-reload) rather than
 * reimplementing a second, weaker copy of it.
 *
 * The backend counterpart is `_case_pick` in backend/app/api/routes/chat.py.
 * A pick carries no message, which is why the route accepts a request whose
 * `commands` produce no text.
