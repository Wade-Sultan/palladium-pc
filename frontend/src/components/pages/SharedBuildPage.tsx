 * chat uses. The snapshot is shaped as BuildData minus `key`. Reusing the
 * card gets live listings and marketplace buttons for free; its feedback
 * thumbs are suppressed via OutsideConversation, since a visitor holding a
 * share link has no conversation of their own to rate.
 *
 * No auth anywhere: the token in the URL is the whole credential, and the
 * snapshot was stripped of everything conversational before it was stored.
