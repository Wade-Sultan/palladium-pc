/**
 * Turning the backend's state into things that *happened*.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The backend owns the conversation and streams snapshots of
 * it; the client renders whatever it is told. That is the right shape for
 * rendering and the wrong shape for side effects, because a snapshot cannot
 * distinguish "a build just finished" from "a build is present", and a toast,
 * a sound, or an analytics event only ever wants the first. Firing on the
 * second is exactly the bug where opening any finished build from history
 * announced "Build ready!" all over again.
 *
 * So state is tracked here across renders and diffed into discrete transitions.
 * Every consumer then gets to decide, explicitly, which of them should actually
 * do something, rather than inferring it from a value that happens to be set.
 *
 * The first observation of a conversation produces NO transitions. Rehydrated
 * history is a starting position, not news; that single rule is what makes
 * loading an old build silent while finishing a new one is not.
