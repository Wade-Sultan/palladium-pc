 * state rather than an event, which is the substantive change from the SSE
 * adapter this replaced: the browser no longer accumulates it as it streams
 * past, so a reconnect mid-build gets the BuildCard back without having kept
 * anything.
 *
 * `build` hangs off the message that produced it rather than sitting in a
 * top-level slot. A conversation can contain several builds, and a single slot
 * both loses the older ones and re-attaches the survivor to whichever assistant
 * message happens to be last, so asking a follow-up after a build dragged the

 *
 * The BuildCard is rendered by `makeAssistantDataUI({name: "build"})`, which
 * looks for a data part of that name. The same shape `ConversationLoader`
 * rebuilds from persisted metadata, so BuildCard itself is untouched.
 *
 * ONE BUBBLE PER TURN. `convertExternalMessages` starts a new thread message
 * only when it sees a user or system message, so by default it concatenates a
 * run of consecutive assistant messages into a single bubble. Every other turn
 * here is answering something the user typed, so that default is invisible,
 * except after a case pick, which is a click on a card and therefore carries no
 * user message. The picker's turn and the turn that finishes the build are two
 * adjacent assistant messages, and joining them rendered the whole thing as one
 * reply: the case prompt, the cards, the build lead-in and the BuildCard all in
 * one bubble, with the picker wedged in the middle of prose from two different
 * turns instead of reading as the reply it is.
 *
 * `joinStrategy: "none"` keeps each state message its own bubble. That is also
 * a contract with the server, not only a cosmetic choice: assistant-ui ids a
 * converted message by its position in the *converted* list, and
 * `rewind_prefix` in backend/app/services/transport.py reads `parentId` back as
 * an index into state. Every join silently shifts the two apart, so an edit
 * made after a case pick would rewind the conversation to the wrong message.
