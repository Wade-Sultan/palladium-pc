/**
 * Display copy for pipeline progress indicators.
 *
 * The backend emits `{type: "progress", step: "gpu", message: "Choosing GPU…"}`.
 * The `step` is the stable identifier and the `message` is a convenience copy of
 * whatever the Python happened to say. This table is the authority, so changing
 * user-facing wording is a frontend deploy rather than a backend one, and the
 * strings sit somewhere a translation pass can reach them.
 *
 * `message` remains the fallback for any step added to the pipeline that has not
 * been given an entry here yet. A new step should show slightly-off copy, never
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * Step names come from _emit() in
 * backend/app/services/recommender/dspy_pipeline.py and the two run_chat_turn
 * emits in backend/app/services/chat_pipeline.py.
