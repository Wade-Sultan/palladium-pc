/**
 * Typing a code into the composer flips the site instead of sending a message.
 *
 * THESE ARE NOT SECRETS, which is why they carry the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
 * rather than reading as server config. The check happens in the browser, so
 * both values are inlined into the JS bundle at build time and anyone can read
 * them out of devtools in about ten seconds. That is inherent to the feature,
 * a code that never reaches the server cannot be verified by the server, not a
 * shortcut taken here. Never put a value here that matters if it leaks.
 *
 * Inlined *at build time*, not read at runtime: changing either one means a
 * rebuild, not a restart. `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is also what makes them exist in the
 * browser at all; without the prefix Next leaves them out and both read as
 * `undefined`, so the codes would silently never match.

/**
 * An event handler for a composer's submit paths: swallows a code, and passes
 * everything else through untouched.
 *
 * ONE HOOK, FOUR PROPS. A composer has two independent ways to submit. Enter
 * calls `form.requestSubmit()` and lands on Root's `onSubmit`, while the send
 * button is a `type="button"` whose `onClick` calls send() directly and never
 * touches the form, and the thread composer and the edit composer each have
 * both. Guarding three of the four leaves the code sendable by the fourth.
 *
 * `preventDefault()` is what suppresses the send. Both props are merged with
 * Radix's `composeEventHandlers(ours, theirs)`, which runs ours first and skips
 * theirs once the event is defaulted, so the library never sees the submit.
 *
 * WORKS UNMODIFIED IN THE EDIT COMPOSER, because `aui.composer()` resolves to
 * whichever composer is in scope: the thread's under the viewport footer, and a
 * message's edit composer under a MessagePrimitive.Root. That is the same
 * resolution ComposerPrimitive.Input relies on to know which text to show.
 *
 * Editing stays non-destructive throughout, `setText` writes a draft field and
 * never the stored message, so cancelling an edit whose text this cleared
 * still restores the original. See the note on Cancel in thread.tsx.
 *
 * Fires on every code, not only ones that change the mode. Sending "67" while
 * already degenerate re-announces and stays put; the alternative leaks the code
 * into the conversation exactly when the user has lost track of which mode they
 * are in.
