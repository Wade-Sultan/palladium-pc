 * Every logo the app draws, indexed by the two things that select one.
 *
 * TWO DIMENSIONS, NOT ONE. The wordmark has always varied with light/dark; it
 * now also varies with the site mode, and the two are independent, so the
 * options are a 2x2 rather than a list. The icon varies with mode only: it is a
 * single-colour mark that reads on either background, which is why there is no
 * light/dark pair of it to choose between.
 *
 * Kept as a table rather than as string interpolation over the filenames on
 * purpose. The naming is not actually regular, "combined" becomes "special",
 * "palladium-logo" becomes "palladium-logo-special", so a computed path would
 * be a 404 discovered in production rather than a missing key discovered here.
