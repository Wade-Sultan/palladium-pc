# There is no integration between Locust and KEDA, and there should not be:
# Locust drives /chat, builder publishes a turn per request, and the backlog on
# the Pub/Sub subscription is what KEDA reads. The chain is already complete.
# What is missing is a way to see all of it at once. The four things below live
# in four different commands, and the interesting moments are the ones where
# they disagree.
#
#   watch: scripts/watch-scaling.sh
#   drive: the Locust web UI, ChatUser only (see deploy/loadtest/)
#
# BACKLOG is read from the HPA rather than from Cloud Monitoring directly. That
# is deliberate: it is the number KEDA actually acted on, so if it disagrees
# with what the monitoring API reports, the gap between them IS the bug, and
# polling it here costs no API quota and needs no access token.
