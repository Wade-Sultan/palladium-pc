# Restore the Cloud SQL snapshot into the cluster's Postgres, then strip the
# production PII, so a fresh `minikube delete && tilt up` comes back with a
# populated catalog.
#
# RUNS BEFORE THE MIGRATE JOB, NOT AFTER, and the ordering is load-bearing.
# `pg_restore --clean` below drops and recreates every object in the dump,
# including the alembic_version row, so running this after a migration silently
# reverts it and leaves the database on whatever revision production was on when
# the dump was taken. Nothing reports that; it shows up later as the ORM writing
# a column Postgres does not have. Tilt therefore orders postgres -> seed-db ->
# migrate, which is also the sequence production follows on every deploy.
#
# Idempotent: skips when the catalog already has rows, so it costs nothing on
# every subsequent `tilt up`. Pass --force to restore over existing data.
#
# Talks to Postgres through Tilt's 5433 port-forward rather than exec'ing into
# the pod, so the host's pg_restore does the work and the dump never has to be
# copied into the container.
