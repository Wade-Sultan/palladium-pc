#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Logs for builder / commerce / admin on the prod GKE cluster.
#
# TWO SOURCES, because they answer different questions:
#
#   live (default)  kubectl, straight off the running pods. Instant, streams,
#                   but only sees pods that exist *right now*. A pod that
#                   crashed or was replaced takes its logs with it, and with
#                   maxUnavailable: 0 every rollout replaces every pod, so
#                   "the error I saw ten minutes ago" is routinely already gone.
#
#   -H / --history  Cloud Logging, which GKE feeds automatically. Survives pod
#                   death, restarts and rollouts, searchable server-side. This
#                   is the one to reach for when debugging something that
#                   already happened.
#
# Cloud Logging needs no setup: GKE ships container stdout/stderr there by
# default. Metrics land in Cloud Monitoring via GMP, logs here: both queryable
# from the GCP console.
