"""Per-turn event stream on Valkey, using Redis Streams.

WHY A STREAM AND NOT PUB/SUB (either Valkey's or Google's). Both are fire-and-
forget: a subscriber only sees what is published while it is attached. The
browser attaches *after* POST /chat returns, so with pub/sub every event the
worker emitted in between is simply gone, and that gap is exactly the "Building
your PC…" progress the user is waiting to see. A stream is a durable log with
monotonic IDs, so a reader can start at 0 and replay from the beginning, or
resume from the last ID it saw. That is what makes both the initial attach and a
mid-build reconnect work, and it is why the frontend can send Last-Event-ID.

KEY LAYOUT. `chat:evt:{<turn_id>}`. The braces are a real cluster hash tag, not
formatting. Everything for one turn hashes to one slot, so the stream and the
chat buffer (app/services/chat_buffer.py) would live on the same shard and could
be touched together without a cross-slot error.

That is deliberately future-proofing rather than a present requirement: prod runs
a Cluster Mode Disabled instance (forced by the `custom-pico` node type. See
app/core/valkey.py), where there is one shard and slots are irrelevant. The tags
cost nothing there and mean a later move to a clustered instance is a config flip
instead of a key-naming migration. Keep them.

TERMINATION IS EXPLICIT. The last entry is always `{"type": "end"}`, written by
the producer after persistence has run. Readers stop on it. Inferring the end
from the pipeline's own `done` event would race: `done` is emitted before
_save_turn commits, so a reader that stopped there could disconnect while the
turn was still being written, and an evict-on-commit buffer would be deleted
under a reader that had not finished.

#
# A list of turn ids that have been published to Pub/Sub but not yet picked up
# by a worker. It exists for exactly one reader. KEDA's `redis` scaler, which
# polls LLEN to decide whether the worker pool needs to exist at all
# (deploy/overlays/prod/keda-worker.yaml).
#
# WHY NOT JUST USE THE PUB/SUB BACKLOG, which is already the scaler's steady-
# state signal. Because of when it becomes visible, not what it says: Cloud
# Monitoring samples subscription/num_undelivered_messages every 60s and then
# withholds it for up to another 120s, so the metric that proves a turn is
# waiting arrives one to three minutes after the user pressed send. With the
# pool floored at zero that delay IS the cold start. This list is written
# synchronously on the dispatch path and read directly, so the same fact is
# available to the scaler within one polling interval.
#
# It does not replace the Pub/Sub trigger, and must not: Pub/Sub is the real
# queue and the authority on depth under load. This is a wake-up signal that
# happens to use the same per-replica arithmetic, so the two triggers agree
# about how many pods the work deserves and differ only in how fast they say so.
#
# REMOVED AT PICKUP, NOT AT COMPLETION. The question this answers is "does a
# worker exist to take this turn", which is settled the moment one has it, so a
# worker that crashes mid-turn leaks nothing here, and Pub/Sub redelivery (which
# never goes back through /chat) needs no second push. The only way an entry
# outlives its turn is a turn that no worker ever receives, which is a real
# condition the pool should stay up for.
#
# No hash tag on the key. Every other key in this module carries one so a turn's
# state co-locates; this is a single global list, so there is nothing to
# co-locate it with and a tag would only pin it to an arbitrary slot.
