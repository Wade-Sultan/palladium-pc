"""OpenRouter access for the chat pipeline, through LangChain.

Everything here exists so that LangSmith sees real LLM runs, with token counts
attached, rather than the opaque HTTP spans a raw `openai.AsyncOpenAI` client
produces. `ChatOpenRouter` populates `usage_metadata` automatically, which is
what makes the per-project spend view in LangSmith work at all.

The DSPy build steps deliberately do NOT come through here. They reach
OpenRouter via litellm, and `app/services/recommender/recording.py` reads
`dspy.settings.lm.history` for their cost. Swapping their LM would break that
and the GEPA tooling with it. They reach LangSmith through litellm's own
callback instead; see app/core/tracing.py.
