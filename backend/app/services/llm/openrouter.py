"""ChatOpenRouter construction and per-call usage capture.

TWO NUMBERS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME NUMBER.

  tokens   `usage_metadata` on the response. This is what LangSmith reads to
           tally spend, and it is the reason this module exists.
  dollars  OpenRouter's own `cost`, which is what actually gets billed and what
           `conversations.total_cost_usd` has always recorded. LangSmith derives
           its figure from token counts against a pricing table that has no
           entry for models like `google/gemma-4-31b-it`, so its dollar estimate
           is not a substitute.

WHERE COST COMES FROM. As of langchain-openrouter 0.2.7 `cost` (and
`cost_details`) arrive in `response_metadata` on BOTH paths, streaming included,
the usage-only chunk carries them alongside the token counts. So the ordinary
case needs no second request: `usage_from_message` reads the figure straight off
the response.

`fetch_generation_cost` remains the fallback for when it does not arrive, and
`_finalize_usage` in chat_pipeline.py calls it only when `cost_usd` came back
None. It reads OpenRouter's final accounting from the generation endpoint, keyed
by the id preserved in `response_metadata["id"]`, after the last token has
already been streamed, so it costs latency on the turn's bookkeeping, never on
anything the user is waiting to read.

An earlier version of this module had it the other way round: the package used to
drop cost when streaming, so the generation lookup was the primary path rather
than the fallback. If you are wondering why the fallback looks over-built for
something that rarely fires, that is why.

WHAT LANGSMITH DOES AND DOES NOT READ. Neither number above reaches LangSmith
directly. Its OTel ingestion maps token counts only, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`
, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens` and the two `*_token_details`, and there is no
cost attribute in that mapping at all. Dollars are computed server-side by
multiplying those counts against LangSmith's model price map, so a model it has
no price entry for shows tokens and a blank cost no matter what this module
attaches to the response. Making spend appear there is a matter of registering
prices for the `google/gemma-*` slugs in LangSmith, not of sending it more data.
