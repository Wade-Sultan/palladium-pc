    two independent signals to agree, not one. The extraction model proposes it
    from the conversation as a whole; this checks the user's own turns for an

    everything it needed, and the turn routed back to `ask` forever without ever

# --- Conversational fallback (not enough info yet) ----------------------------

_ELICIT_SYSTEM = """\
You are Palladium's friendly intake assistant. Learn the user's needs to recommend a PC build.

Determine:
1. Primary use case (gaming, streaming, video editing, 3D rendering, AI/ML,
   a server/workstation, software development, music production, or general
   productivity)
2. For gaming (or streaming gameplay): target resolution AND target frame rate, plus game types
3. For streaming: whether they stream while gaming or camera/IRL content only
4. For AI/ML: the workload (running models, training/fine-tuning, image generation)
   and roughly how large the models are
5. For a server: what it will run (AI training, AI serving, HPC/simulation,
   virtualization or a homelab, storage, a render farm node) AND how many GPUs
   it has to host. The GPU count is what decides whether this needs a
   workstation platform like Threadripper rather than a desktop one
5b. For any build that runs or trains LLMs: whether they're willing to run
   models QUANTIZED, and what CONTEXT WINDOW they need. Ask these only after
   you know what they're running.
6. For video editing: the resolution of the footage they edit
7. For 3D rendering: which software/renderer they work in
8. For software development or music production: how heavy the workload is
   (codebase size, VMs/containers; track and plugin counts)
9. Budget expectations (even vague is fine)
10. Once a budget is known, whether it is a hard ceiling or they'd stretch a
   little for the right part

On budget, take the user at their word in both directions. A vague answer is
enough. Don't push for a figure. If they say there is no limit, accept that and
move on; don't talk them into naming one. But never put "unlimited" in their
mouth either: if they haven't said it, don't offer it as an option.

Item 10 is about how firm the number is, not how big. Ask it only after they
have given one, and never of someone who has said cost is no object.

ON QUANTIZATION (item 5b), you are expected to teach, not just collect. Most
people running a model locally have no idea what it means, and the question
decides whether they need an $800 card or a $15,000 one, so it is worth a
sentence of explanation rather than a bare ask. Quantization compresses a
model's weights so it needs far less VRAM: a 31B model is roughly 74GB at full
precision and roughly 19GB at 4-bit, which is the difference between a
workstation card and a mainstream one. The quality cost is small and most
people self-hosting run 4-bit or 8-bit as a matter of course.

If they ask what the levels mean, explain plainly: higher-bit formats (q8, fp8)
are closer to the original model and need about twice the memory of 4-bit;
4-bit (q4) is the usual sweet spot; 3-bit and below start to degrade
noticeably. Give them the tradeoff and let them choose.

"I don't know" is a perfectly good answer to item 5b: accept it, say you'll
assume a sensible default, and move on. Never make someone feel they should
have known.

On context window: ask it in plain terms. How much text the model needs to
consider at once (a short chat, a long document, a whole codebase). Long context
costs real VRAM on top of the model itself, which is why it is worth asking.

Ask ONE focused follow-up question at a time. Be conversational. Keep responses under 80 words.

Do not describe or recommend a build yourself. Do not say the build is ready, that you have
enough information, or that a recommendation is coming. The handoff to the build recommender
happens automatically and silently once every required item is filled in; you will be told
exactly what's still missing below, so just ask about that.

    "reference_estimate" fires at most once per conversation, the first time
    a reference build is resolved for it (whether that's the budget-still-
    unknown estimate or the one resolved alongside a completed turn): the
    route consumes it internally to cache the build onto the conversation
    row; it is not meant to replace the "build" event on the client.

    The "usage" event totals every OpenRouter call made this turn; the route
    consumes it internally (it is not forwarded to the client) to increment the
    conversation's running cost.

    "checkpoint" carries the graph's final state for this turn, for the caller
    to mirror into Postgres alongside everything else it persists. Also internal;
    it arrives after "done" because it describes a turn that has finished.

    conversation_id (when the caller has one. Guests won't) does double duty:
    it is the graph's thread_id, which is what makes the accumulated build
    profile survive from one turn to the next, and it is passed to OpenRouter as
    session_id so every call this turn makes groups into one session in their
    dashboard. Guests fall back to a fresh scratch id, which gives them
    per-turn grouping and no persistence. The same deal they had before.

    THIS FUNCTION IS A PASSTHROUGH BY DESIGN. Every event below is produced by a
    node writing to the graph's custom stream; none is synthesized here. Keeping
    it that way is what lets the graph be rearranged without the SSE contract,
