"""Saving and reclaiming a build paused at the case step.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The pipeline makes nine LLM-backed decisions before it
reaches the case step, then has to stop and ask a human which of three cases
they want. Holding the turn open across that wait costs a blocked worker thread
and a Pub/Sub lease for as long as the user takes to answer, and still fails
whoever answers after the timeout. So the turn ends instead: everything decided
so far is written here, and the pick starts a fresh turn that picks the
pipeline back up exactly where it stopped.

TWO STORES, ONE ANSWER. Valkey is the read path and answers essentially every
resume within its TTL. Postgres is the durable copy, because eviction or expiry
here does not cost a cache miss. It costs the whole build. `load_and_claim`
tries them in that order and each store's claim is atomic on its own terms:
GETDEL on Valkey, a conditional UPDATE on Postgres. Whichever answers first,
the resume happens at most once, so a double-click or a redelivered message
cannot produce two builds.

TWO KINDS OF PAUSE share these stores: a build stopped at the case step, and a
complete-system offer waiting for the user to take it or ask for a custom
build (app/services/systems/offer.py). Both are "a turn ended on a choice that
must be redeemed at most once, by the conversation that saw it", so they share
the claim. A payload's `kind` is checked before claiming, alongside the
conversation, so a token of one kind can never spend a pause of the other.
Payloads written before `kind` existed are case pauses.

WHAT IS NOT HERE. A never-resumed pause leaves a row behind with `resumed_at`
still null. Sweeping those, and recording them as ABANDONED build_sessions,
which is what that status was defined for, wants a periodic job rather than a
request path, so `created_at` is indexed for it and nothing here deletes them.
