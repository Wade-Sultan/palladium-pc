=========
Thin async wrapper over the OpenAI embeddings endpoint.

Deliberately not routed through OpenRouter: OpenRouter proxies chat completions
and exposes no embeddings endpoint, so this is the one LLM-adjacent call in the
codebase that talks to a provider directly. That also means it does not appear
in the OpenRouter cost telemetry the recommender relies on. Embedding spend is
tracked by row count instead (see EmbeddingResult.total_tokens).

DEGRADES TO None, NEVER RAISES UPWARD. Every caller of this module treats an
absent embedding as "no semantic match available", which is the same state the
system is in before the first backfill runs. Making an embedding failure fatal
would take down the build pipeline over an optional enrichment.
