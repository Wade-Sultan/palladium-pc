========
Reads and writes the `embeddings` table: the reconcile sweep that keeps vectors
in step with the catalog, and the similarity search that reads them back.

THE SWEEP IS THE WHOLE SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGY. There is deliberately no
"embed on insert" hook. Parts enter this database from at least three places,
the discovery pipeline, the admin app's Prisma writes, and hand-run SQL, and
only one of them runs through this codebase at all. A creation hook would cover
that one and silently miss the rest, producing a vector set that is wrong in a
way nothing detects. Content-addressed reconciliation covers all three by
construction: anything whose source text does not match its stored hash gets
re-embedded on the next pass, no matter who wrote it or how.

That also makes the sweep safe to run on a schedule and cheap when idle: a
pass over an unchanged catalog issues one SELECT per entity type, hashes in
process, and makes zero API calls.
