# Turning a bag of Google Shopping prices into one street price.
#
# The mean over everything that passed the title filter, what this module used
# to apply, is systematically too high, because the contamination in shopping
# results is one-sided. A search for "RTX 5080" returns the card at ~$1000
# alongside whole gaming PCs containing it at $2500-$4000; nothing sells for
# *less* than a fifth of the part's price in the same result set except
# accessories. One $3500 prebuilt in twelve results moves the mean by ~$200 and
# the median by nothing, which is the entire reason the applied figure is now
# the median of a trimmed sample rather than a raw mean.
#
# Three defences, cheapest first:
#   1. title filtering, before this module ever sees a price
#      (title_match.exclusion_reason): kills the prebuilts and bundles by name
#   2. an MSRP anchor, when the target has one: kills anything implausible in
#      absolute terms
#   3. a robust band around the median (below). Kills what is left, without
#      assuming the sample is normal or that we know the true price already
#
# Every rejection is reported per-sample rather than just dropped, so
# price_checks.raw_results keeps the negative examples the eventual legitimacy
# classifier trains on.

# Below this many usable samples the median is not worth trusting, so the check
# is recorded but no price is applied. The part keeps whatever it had and gets
# re-checked next cycle. Two results that agree can easily be two listings of
# the same wrong thing.
