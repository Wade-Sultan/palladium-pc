# Deciding whether a shopping result is actually the part we searched for.
#
# Three independent gates, because they catch different failures:
#
#   identity    — do the model, suffix and capacity agree with the query?
#   similarity  — does the rest of the title resemble the requested product?
#   disqualifiers — is this a *part* at all? Catches the listings that score
#                 well precisely because they contain the part's full name: a
#                 prebuilt desktop built around it, a bundle, a five-pack, a
#                 replacement bracket for it.
#
# The second gate is the one that matters for price accuracy. A high-similarity
# whole-system listing is the single biggest source of overestimation, and no
# similarity threshold can exclude it — "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Gaming Desktop
# PC" is, by every token measure, an excellent match for "NVIDIA GeForce RTX
# 5080".

# Below this, a result is treated as "probably not the part we searched for"
# and excluded from the price stats — but
# every raw result is still stored with its score and its reason, so this
# threshold isn't a hard data-loss point, just a stats-inclusion gate. The
# eventual ML classifier trains on exactly this signal plus the ones it rejects.
