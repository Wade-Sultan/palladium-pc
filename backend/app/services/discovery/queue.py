"""Demand queue on Valkey for catalog terms nobody has a row for.

WHAT THIS CLOSES. `catalog_match` resolves the titles a user names against the
games / software / ai_models catalogs, and anything it cannot match is dropped
into `unmatched_terms` and forgotten. Those terms are the single best signal we
have about what the catalog is missing, a user asking for "Gemma 4 31B" the
week it ships is telling us exactly what to go find, and until now the only
consequence was a build sized without it.

So an unmatched term is enqueued here, and the discovery sweep drains the most
asked-for ones on its next run. The user who triggered it does not benefit; the
next one does.

A SORTED SET, SCORED BY DEMAND, not a list. With roughly ten searches per sweep
the ordering is the whole design: FIFO would spend that budget on whatever was
typed first, while ZINCRBY spends it on what people keep asking for. Dedupe comes
free with it, which a list would need a separate SET to get.

WRITTEN FROM THE GRAPH, READ BY A JOB. The enqueue happens inside the build
pipeline, i.e. inside a LangGraph node, and is a Valkey write, which is exactly
what that path is allowed to do. Everything that reaches Postgres happens later,
in the sweep. See app/services/telemetry_buffer.py for the same split.

THIS IS UNAUTHENTICATED USER INPUT REACHING A PAID API, eventually. Guards, in
order of how much they matter: a minimum score before a term is eligible (so one
person typing nonsense cannot spend Tavily budget), a length cap and a character
filter on enqueue, a bounded key size, and a TTL so a term nobody has mentioned
in months stops being searched forever.
