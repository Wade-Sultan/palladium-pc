benchmarks.py
=============
Backfills `benchmark_scores` on CPUs and GPU chipsets that don't have them.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE RUN FROM DISCOVERY. Discovery finds products that are not
in the catalog yet and stages them for review. This targets rows that are
already in the catalog and already approved, and enriches one column on them.
Different target set, different source pages (review outlets and results
databases rather than vendor spec sheets), and, because the numbers are
objective and every one of them arrives with a verbatim snippet backing it,
different write semantics: values land on the row directly instead of queueing
for approval.

WHAT DEPENDS ON THIS. services/recommender/scoring.py ranks CPU and GPU
candidates on these numbers and injects the result into every candidate list the
LLM sees. Its dominance gate additionally refuses to fire unless *every*
candidate in a set is scored, so coverage is not cosmetic: a single unmeasured
chipset in a budget band disables the LLM bypass for every build that lands in
that band. Getting coverage to 100% for the parts that actually appear in
candidate sets is what turns the gate on.

PROVENANCE. Source URLs and the snippet behind each figure are written into the
same JSONB under a reserved `_sources` key. CPUBenchmarkScores and
GPUBenchmarkScores both set extra="allow", so this validates; scoring.py reads
only the known suite keys and ignores it. Keeping provenance beside the number
rather than in a side table is what makes a suspicious score auditable months
later without a join.
