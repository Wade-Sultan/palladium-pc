"""Hugging Face Hub as a first-class discovery source for the ai_model category.

Every other category goes search -> fetch -> LLM extraction, because hardware
specs only exist as prose on vendor pages. AI models don't have that problem:
the Hub publishes the same fields as structured JSON, including an exact
parameter count read off the safetensors index rather than a marketing claim.
So the ai_model path skips Tavily and the extraction model entirely, which
makes it both free and non-hallucinating.

What it deliberately does NOT produce is the ai_workloads matrix. A workload
row is a curated engineering claim about VRAM at a given task and precision;
the Hub has no opinion on that. This populates the ai_models catalog entity
only, and workload rows stay hand-authored in the admin.
