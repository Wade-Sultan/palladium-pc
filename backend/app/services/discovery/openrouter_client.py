"""Raw OpenRouter client for the discovery pipeline.

WHY THIS IS NOT app/services/llm/. The chat pipeline moved to LangChain's
ChatOpenRouter so LangSmith can tally its spend as real LLM runs. Discovery did
not, for two reasons that are about this pipeline rather than about preference:

  * It leans on `response_format` with a per-category JSON schema, and on
    multimodal content parts (rasterized PDF spec sheets). Both are expressed
    natively here and would need re-expressing against LangChain's abstractions
    for no gain.
  * It is a CronJob, not a conversation. Its spend belongs to a catalog refresh,
    not to a `conversations` row, and nothing asks LangSmith to attribute it.

These three helpers were previously imported from `chat_pipeline`, which is why
they look like chat code. They moved here when chat stopped using them, so that
their only caller owns them.
