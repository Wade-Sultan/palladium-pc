  the requested product exists. Its snippet must quote the official product
  listing or announcement for this exact product. A release need not be recent.
- Never turn a predicted specification into a fact, even for a confirmed product.
- Extract ONLY what this page states about the requested product. Never guess,
  infer, or fill in from prior knowledge. If the page does not state a field,
  return {"value": null, "snippet": null} for it.
- Every non-null value must include a short verbatim snippet (max 200
  characters) copied from the page that supports it.
- Enum-like fields use lowercase vocabulary (e.g. "ddr5" never "DDR5",
  brands "amd"/"intel"/"nvidia", form factors "eatx"/"ssi_eeb" never "E-ATX").
- If the page covers multiple products, extract the one matching the request
  and null everything you cannot attribute to it specifically.
- msrp_usd is the launch/list price in US dollars.
- Capacities are in GB: a "4TB" drive is 4000, a "128GB (4x32GB)" memory kit is
  128 with modules=4 and module_capacity_gb=32.
- Server and workstation parts state things consumer parts don't (PCIe lanes,

  unconfirmed. When a page mixes confirmed products with rumored ones, return

- Skip products mentioned as older comparisons or context.
- Use the canonical retail name a buyer would search, exactly as the page
  writes it. No marketing copy, no prices, no verdicts.
- One entry per distinct product. Never invent a product the page does not name.
- Name individual models only. Skip families, series and generations ("RTX

  cannot be extracted into one catalog row.
