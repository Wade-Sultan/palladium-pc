# Builder -> commerce calls.
#
# Commerce owns transactional email (internal/email, Resend) and is the only
# service holding RESEND_API_KEY. See the per-service secret scoping in
# deploy/overlays/prod/patches/secrets-scoped.yaml. Rather than duplicate that
# credential and the templates into the builder image, the builder asks
# commerce to send.
#
# Plain JSON over the in-cluster Service DNS, authenticated with a shared
# secret, mirroring how admin calls the builder's discovery endpoints with
# X-Admin-Key. Deliberately not gRPC: the two services already speak HTTP+JSON
# to each other's clients, and one internal endpoint does not justify a proto
# toolchain in two languages.
#
# Only the customer's id crosses the wire, never their address: commerce reads
# users.email itself, so an address cannot go stale in transit and the builder
# never has to carry one around to send mail.
