"""Runs one chat turn to completion, independently of who asked for it.

This is the single implementation shared by the worker (app/worker.py, driven by
Pub/Sub) and by the API's inline fallback (app/api/routes/chat.py, used when
Pub/Sub or Valkey is unconfigured). Keeping one implementation matters more than
usual here: the fallback path is the one that runs in local development and in
the test suite, so if it diverged from the worker path, every test would be
exercising code that never runs in production.

The turn's events are written to Valkey (app/services/turn_stream.py) rather than
returned, because the caller holding the HTTP connection is generally not the
process running the turn.

ORDER OF OPERATIONS AT THE END OF A TURN, and each step depends on the one
before it:
  1. pipeline finishes            -> all events emitted
  2. buffer written               -> turn is recoverable if 3 fails
  3. Postgres commit confirmed    -> turn is durable
  4. buffer evicted               -> only now, and only on a confirmed commit
  5. terminal entry written       -> readers may disconnect
Step 5 is last so that a client watching the stream cannot leave before its turn
is durable, which is what makes "the build finished" mean the same thing to the
user and to the database.
