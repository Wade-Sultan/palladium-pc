"""Write-behind buffer on Valkey for build telemetry.

THE INVARIANT THIS EXISTS TO KEEP. The LangGraph turn may write to Valkey and
read from Postgres, but it must never write to Postgres. Persistence belongs to
`save_turn`, which runs after the graph stream has drained. Build telemetry was
the one violation: `BuildRecorder.finish()` opened its own session from inside
the `build` node and committed a `build_sessions` row plus every
`module_decisions` row. This moves that write off the graph path. The recorder
pushes here, and `drain_pending` (called outside the graph) does the insert.

WHY A LIST AND NOT A STREAM. Streams with consumer groups are the textbook
at-least-once primitive, and turn_stream already uses them. They are not needed
here because `build_sessions.id` is a natural idempotency key: the drain inserts
with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so a payload processed twice is a no-op rather than
a duplicate row. That reduces the requirement from "exactly-once delivery" to
"at-least-once delivery plus an idempotent write", which a plain list satisfies.

PEEK, COMMIT, THEN TRIM, never LPOP. Same discipline as chat_buffer's eviction:
entries leave the buffer only once Postgres has confirmed the write. LPOP would
remove them first, and a failure between the pop and the commit would lose
telemetry that had already been paid for in tokens.

NO TTL, A LENGTH CAP INSTEAD. Unlike a chat buffer this key is not per
conversation, so an expiry would silently drop pending work rather than reclaim
an abandoned key. A permanently failing drain is bounded by _MAX_PENDING, which
discards the OLDEST entries. Telemetry ages into irrelevance, so under overflow
the recent runs are the ones worth keeping.
