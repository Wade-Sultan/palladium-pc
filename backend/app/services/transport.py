"""assistant-transport adapter: turn events become server-authoritative state.

WHAT CHANGED, CONCEPTUALLY. The old SSE contract streamed *deltas* and left the
browser to accumulate them — `model-adapter.ts` held `fullText`, pushed progress
into one Zustand store and the BuildCard into another, and re-yielded the whole
content array on every token. assistant-transport inverts that: the server owns
the state, mutations to `controller.state` are diffed and streamed, and the
client renders whatever it is told.

That inversion is what makes resume cheap. A reconnecting browser does not need
to have kept anything, and the server does not need to know what it missed —
replaying the turn's Valkey stream from the beginning rebuilds the same state,
because `turn_stream.tail(turn_id, last_id="0")` was always able to replay from
zero. The Last-Event-ID bookkeeping that used to exist on both sides is gone.

SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE MEANS *ALL* OF IT, INCLUDING THE USER'S OWN MESSAGE. The
runtime clears its optimistic echo of the message just typed as soon as the first
state operation arrives, and it renders only what state says. So the message has
to be put *into* state by this module — `_append_pending` does it, and
`messages_from_state` then reads the whole conversation back out of one place.
Leaving it out does not merely lose a bubble on screen: the thread renders empty
and drops back to the welcome screen mid-send, and the next turn round-trips a
history with no user turns in it, so the elicitation model silently answers
without ever seeing what was asked of it.

OPERATIONS ARE DELTAS AGAINST THE CLIENT'S OWN STATE. `create_run(state=...)`
does not transmit that state — the browser uses the state it POSTed as the base
and applies our ops on top (`AssistantMessageAccumulator`'s `initialMessage` is
built from its own `agentStateRef`). Two consequences, both load-bearing:
mutations have to go through `controller.state` so they emit ops, and the base
we mutate has to be exactly what the client sent, or every index in those ops
points at the wrong message.

THE PIPELINE IS UNTOUCHED. This module reads the same event vocabulary
`run_chat_turn` has always emitted (progress / token / build / done). Nothing
about dispatch, the worker, or the DSPy pipeline knows this layer exists.

    being appended *after*. So replacing history rather than appending to it is
    a decision made here, not in the browser.

    The ids are array indices. `convertExternalMessages` labels each converted
    message with its position (`fromThreadMessageLike(joined, idx.toString())`),
