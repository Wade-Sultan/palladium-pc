"""Write-behind chat buffer on Valkey, keyed by conversation.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Today a turn is only durable once _save_turn commits at
the very end of the request (app/api/routes/chat.py). Everything before that,
the accumulated assistant text, the resolved build, the OpenRouter spend, lives
only in local variables inside a generator. If the client disconnects, FastAPI
cancels that generator and all of it is discarded, including cost that was
already incurred and should still be billed to the conversation.

So the turn is written here first, incrementally, and deleted only once Postgres
has confirmed the commit. A crash between the two leaves a buffer behind, which
is the recoverable state; a crash before the buffer write loses only a turn that
had produced nothing yet.

EVICTION IS ON CONFIRMED COMMIT, NOT ON COMPLETION. `discard()` is called after
`db.commit()` returns, never after _save_turn merely finishes. _save_turn
swallows its exceptions and returns normally on failure, so "the function
returned" and "the rows are in Postgres" are very different claims. See
`_save_turn`'s `committed` flag.

CHEAP TTL AS BACKSTOP. CHAT_BUFFER_TTL_S expires anything that never commits, so
a worker killed mid-turn cannot leak a key forever. It is deliberately longer
than the stream's TTL so the buffer outlives the events describing it.

    SCAN, never KEYS. KEYS is O(N) *and* blocks the server for the whole
    traversal, which on a shared instance means blocking every in-flight turn's
    XREAD too. SCAN is cursor-based and interruptible. In cluster mode redis-py
    fans `scan_iter` out across every primary, so this is one pass per shard.

    Cheap here only because the key count is small by construction: buffers are
    deleted on commit and TTL'd otherwise. If that ever stops being true, this
    scan is itself the thing that gets expensive, which, conveniently, is also
    exactly when the gauge it feeds is screaming.

    REDUCE_SUM; summing would multiply the count by the replica count.

    a worker-only gauge goes silent on every quiet stretch and pages for an idle
    cluster. builder never scales below 2 (hpa.yaml), so hosting the same loop
