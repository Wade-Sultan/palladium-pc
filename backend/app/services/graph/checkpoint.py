"""LangGraph checkpointer backed by Valkey, with Postgres as the long backstop.

WHY THIS IS HAND-WRITTEN RATHER THAN `langgraph-checkpoint-redis`. That package
stores checkpoints as RedisJSON documents and finds them through a RediSearch
index queried by thread_id/checkpoint_ns/checkpoint_id. Memorystore for Valkey
blocks MODULE LOAD outright, so neither module can be present. Memorystore for
Redis Cluster 8.0+ looks like a way out, it has native JSON and exposes
FT.CREATE, but its search is a vector engine wearing RediSearch's command
names: a VECTOR field is required, only HASH keys can be indexed (not JSON), and
tag/numeric predicates are documented as unusable except alongside a vector
query. That is exactly the standalone metadata lookup the package performs, so
index creation would fail there too. Migrating buys nothing, which is why we
didn't.

What is left needs GET/SET/ZADD and nothing else, which every Valkey and Redis
variant supports identically. Writing it here also means it reuses the pool,
the key conventions and the degradation contract in app/core/valkey.py instead
of opening a second connection that respects none of them.

TWO TIERS, DIFFERENT JOBS.
  Valkey    every checkpoint and every pending write, for GRAPH_CHECKPOINT_TTL_S.
            This is what makes a turn resumable mid-node.
  Postgres  the latest checkpoint only, mirrored by app/services/turn_runner.py
            inside the same transaction that persists the turn. This is what
            makes a CONVERSATION resumable next week, after the TTL has expired
            or Memorystore has been flushed.
Hydration runs one way: a Valkey miss for a real conversation reads Postgres and
warms Valkey back up. A Postgres miss is simply a new conversation.

KEY LAYOUT mirrors app/services/turn_stream.py. `{thread_id}` is a cluster hash
tag, not formatting, so a conversation's checkpoints, buffer and event stream all
hash to one slot. Prod is Cluster Mode Disabled today and slots are irrelevant
there; the tags cost nothing and keep a later move to a clustered instance a
config flip rather than a key migration.
