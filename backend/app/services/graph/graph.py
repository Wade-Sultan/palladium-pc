"""Assembly and caching of the compiled chat turn graph.

    START → collect → route ─┬─ (incomplete) → ask ────────────→ finalize → END
                             └─ (complete)   → build ─┬─ present → finalize → END
                                                      └─ (paused) → finalize → END

The `paused` branch is the case picker: the builder stops after choosing three
cases, saves the pipeline mid-flight (app/services/paused_build.py) and ends
the turn without a build. There is nothing for `present` to introduce until the
user picks, and the pick arrives as its own turn, which resumes the pipeline
outside the graph entirely. See resume_build in chat_pipeline.py.

The builder is one node, not ten. Its ten DSPy steps have their own sequencing,
their own budget allocation and their own telemetry recorder in
app/services/recommender/dspy_pipeline.py; splitting them across graph nodes
would duplicate all three and buy nothing, because nothing branches between them.
