    Select additional case fans for this build, if needed.

    If included case fans are sufficient for this build's thermal requirements,

    many of it to buy.

    fan_quantity is a count of the chosen product as it is sold, which is not
    the same as a count of fans: candidates carry pack_count, so a 3-pack
    filling three empty slots is fan_quantity 1, not 3. Never order more than
    empty_fan_slots worth of fans — airflow the case cannot mount is money
    spent on nothing.

    Size the count to the heat actually being removed. A build with several
    high-TDP GPUs is dumping hundreds of watts into the case and wants every
    slot populated; a low-power desktop is usually fine on the included fans.
