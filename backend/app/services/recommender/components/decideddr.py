    - DDR4: cheaper RAM and motherboards, still perfectly capable for gaming
      and general productivity. Makes sense on tight budgets or workloads
      that don't benefit from extra bandwidth.
    - DDR5: higher bandwidth, future-proof, required for newer platforms.
      Worth it for content creation, heavy multitasking, ML workloads, or
      when the budget comfortably supports it.
