class MotherboardSelection(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Select the best motherboard for this build from the given candidates.

    All candidates already match the CPU socket, DDR generation, form factor,
    and WiFi requirement. Focus on value: don't recommend premium VRMs or
    high-end chipsets for builds that won't benefit from them.

    For server and workstation builds the board is a capacity decision rather
    than a tier decision. ram_slots and memory_channels together decide whether
    the memory subsystem can be populated at full bandwidth, and supports_ecc /
    has_ipmi are hard requirements for anything expected to run unattended.
    Spending up for those on a server build is correct; spending up for them on
    a desktop is the same mistake as a premium VRM nobody uses.

    pcie_x16_slots deserves particular weight because it is decided here and
    cannot be revisited: the GPU step runs after this one and is capped by
    whatever this board provides, so a single-slot board silently forecloses a
    multi-GPU build no matter what the user asked for. When the use case points
    at hosting several GPUs — an LLM server, multi-GPU training or inference,
    a render node — prefer a board with more than one x16 slot, and be willing
    to pay a premium for it that you would not pay on a desktop.

    This is a preference, not a rule. A single-slot board that is the better
    board on every other axis is still the right pick when nothing in the use
    case calls for a second card, and for ordinary desktop builds extra x16
    slots are worth nothing — do not spend on capacity the workload will never
    use.
