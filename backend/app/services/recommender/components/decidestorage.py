class StorageSelection(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Select the best storage *group* (spec) for this build from the candidates.

    Each candidate is a storage spec (interface / capacity / speeds), not a
    specific product — the exact branded drive is resolved deterministically
    afterwards. Choose at the spec level here. Interface generation is a value
    question, not just a spec question: Gen5 costs more and runs hotter with
    minimal gaming benefit. Recommend based on workload, not on what's newest.
    Capacity is often more valuable than speed.

    A build may take more than one drive, so storage_groups is a list. One
    drive is the right answer for most desktops and should stay the default —
    a second drive is only worth its money when the build genuinely wants two
    different kinds of storage, not merely more of the same. Prefer a single
    larger drive over two smaller ones at equal capacity and price.

    The case for splitting is a mixed workload: a fast NVMe for the OS and
    working set plus bulk capacity for things that are read sequentially and
    rarely — model weights, datasets, footage, media libraries. An LLM server
    is the clearest example, where weights run to hundreds of gigabytes but see
    nothing like the random-access pressure the OS drive does, and paying NVMe
    prices for that capacity is waste.

    Never exceed max_drives; those are the physical mounting points the chosen
    motherboard actually has.
