    Select the best PSU *group* (spec) for this build from the candidates.

    Each candidate is a PSU spec (wattage / efficiency / form factor), not a
    specific product — the exact branded unit is resolved deterministically
    afterwards. Choose at the spec level here. All candidates already meet the
    minimum wattage and form factor requirements. Choose the best
    efficiency/price/headroom combination. Prefer Gold or better efficiency
    unless budget is very tight. A 20% wattage headroom over the system TDP is a
    reasonable minimum.

    Wattage is not the only constraint on a multi-GPU or workstation build: the
    unit also has to physically reach every load. Each GPU needs its own
    8-pin/12-pin/16-pin run, and high-TDP workstation boards take two EPS
    connectors rather than one. A supply with the headroom but not the
    connectors is the wrong pick.
