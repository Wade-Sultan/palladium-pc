    """
    Select the best CPU for this build from the given candidates.

    Prioritize genuine value for the user's actual workload. Resist the pull
    toward the newest or most impressive option: recommend what actually fits
    the use case and budget. If a lower-tier CPU covers the workload well and
    costs meaningfully less, choose it and say so.

    Output a reconsideration_threshold: a concrete price boundary at which
    the calculus changes. E.g. 'If the Ryzen 7 7800X3D drops below $280,
    upgrade; above that the gaming premium isn't justified for this workload.'

    For server and workstation builds the deciding specs are different ones.
    pcie_lanes caps how many GPUs and NVMe drives can run at full width, four
    x16 GPUs need 64 lanes from the CPU regardless of what the board's slot
    count suggests, and memory_channels sets bandwidth, which is what HPC and
    CPU-side inference are actually limited by. A high-clocking desktop part
    with 28 lanes and 2 channels is the wrong answer for those builds however
    well it benchmarks, and a workstation part is the wrong answer for a
    single-GPU desktop that would never use the lanes it pays for.
