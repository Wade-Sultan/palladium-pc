==================
Quality metrics for the three Decide* steps worth optimizing, CPU, GPU and
motherboard, expressed as GEPA metrics and as pure functions that can be run
retroactively over recorded telemetry.

THE QUESTION EACH METRIC ASKS, in two halves:

  Sufficiency  Does this part actually do the job the profile describes? A build
               that cannot run the user's game is a failed build, no matter what
               it cost. Scored steeply: 90% of the requirement is not 90% good.

  Efficiency   Having cleared the bar, how much money went above it? Some
               headroom is right. The cheapest part that exactly meets today's
               requirement is fragile, because games get heavier and monitors
               get bigger. Far above it is the user overpaying for capability
               the profile never uses.

  score = sufficiency * efficiency

A PRODUCT, NOT A WEIGHTED SUM, because the two are not tradeable. Being cheap
cannot compensate for being unable to run the workload, and a weighted sum would
let it: 0.5 * insufficient + 0.5 * very cheap still passes. The product makes
sufficiency a gate, which is what it actually is.

WHY OVERSHOOT IS PRICED, NOT MEASURED IN PERFORMANCE. A part 40% faster than
needed for 5% more money is not a mistake. It is a good buy. What makes
overshoot bad is specifically the dollars it takes away from the rest of the
build. So efficiency is computed as money spent above the cheapest candidate
that would also have been sufficient, normalized against the slot's budget.
That figure is computable entirely from the candidate set, which
module_decisions already snapshots verbatim, which is what lets these metrics
be run over builds that have already happened rather than needing a fresh
collection campaign.

WHY perf_score CANNOT CARRY THIS ALONE. The perf_score that scoring.py injects
is *set-relative*: best-in-candidate-set is 1.0 by construction. A $1,600 GPU in
a $2,000 build and a $300 GPU in a $600 build both score 1.0. It is the right
signal for ranking within a set and useless as an absolute anchor, so it is used
here only to compare candidates against each other, never to judge "enough".

THE MOTHERBOARD IS NOT A PERFORMANCE METRIC. It is an option-preservation one.
Its sufficiency asks whether the board kept open the expansion the profile
needs. Above all, PCIe x16 slots, because dspy_pipeline._step_gpu takes the
board's slot count as a hard ceiling on gpu_count and there is no going back to
a wider board from there. Under-provisioning slots is unrecoverable; paying for
IPMI and eight memory channels on a gaming build is merely wasteful. The curves
reflect that asymmetry rather than treating both as symmetric error.

EVERY METRIC RETURNS TEXT, NOT JUST A NUMBER. GEPA's whole mechanism is
reflecting on *why* a score was low in order to rewrite an instruction; a metric
that returns a bare float reduces it to random search. See `Appropriateness.
feedback` and the adapters at the bottom.
