optimizing.py
=============
One correct `dspy.GEPA` invocation, shared by every Decide* module's
`optimize()`.

WHY THIS EXISTS. All eleven modules carried the same call:

    dspy.GEPA(metric=metric, num_iterations=num_iterations)

`num_iterations` is not a GEPA parameter, so every one of them raised TypeError
on the first call. The optimizers had never actually been run. Fixing it in
eleven places would have left eleven places to get it wrong again.

WHAT GEPA ACTUALLY NEEDS, none of which the old call supplied:

  A BUDGET. `auto`, `max_full_evals` or `max_metric_calls`: all default to None
  and GEPA refuses to start without exactly one. This is the knob that decides
  what an optimization run costs, so it is deliberately explicit rather than
  buried at a default.

  A REFLECTION LM. GEPA's mechanism is reading the *textual feedback* a metric
  returns and proposing a rewritten instruction from it. That reflection wants a
  strong model, and it does not have to be, should not be, the small model the
  module runs on in production. Optimizing a Gemma-31B prompt using Gemma-31B to
  do the reflecting caps the quality of the rewrite at the reasoning ability of
  the thing being improved.

  A METRIC THAT RETURNS TEXT. See appropriateness.make_gepa_metric. A metric
  returning a bare float turns GEPA into random search over instructions.
