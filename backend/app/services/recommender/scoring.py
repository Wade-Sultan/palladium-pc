scoring.py
==========
Deterministic performance scoring for CPU and GPU candidates, plus the
dominance gate that lets a step skip its LLM call entirely.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The Decide* steps were handed cores, clocks and TDP and left
to infer performance from them. `CPU.benchmark_scores` and
`GPUChipset.benchmark_scores` (JSONB, validated by the pydantic models in
app/models/benchmarks.py) already carry the real numbers and nothing read them.
This module turns them into two fields on every candidate row — `perf_score`
and `perf_per_dollar` — so the model is choosing against measurements instead
of guessing from a spec sheet.

TWO AXES OF DEFENSIVENESS, because benchmark coverage in the catalog is
partial and will stay that way:

  1. A candidate with no usable benchmark data scores None. It is still shown
     to the LLM, still selectable, and simply carries no numbers. Scoring never
     removes a candidate.
  2. The dominance gate (see `find_dominant`) refuses to fire unless *every*
     candidate in the set is scored. A gate that skips the LLM on a partially
     measured set could be skipping past the actual best part.

HOW A SCORE IS BUILT.
  Each workload maps to weights over *axes* (single-thread, multi-thread,
  raster, compute, ...), not over individual benchmarks — because Cinebench
  and Geekbench measure the same axis, and different rows in the catalog carry
  different ones. Within an axis, every benchmark present is normalized against
  the best value in the candidate set (x / max, so ratios are preserved) and
  averaged. The candidate's score is the weighted sum across axes.

  A candidate must carry data for every axis whose weight is at least
  `_MIN_AXIS_WEIGHT`. Without that rule, renormalizing over "the axes we happen
  to have" lets a part with only single-thread data score 1.00 on a rendering
  workload that is decided almost entirely on multi-thread — the exact silent
  mis-ranking this module exists to remove.

  Scores are relative to the candidate set, not absolute. 1.00 means "best in
  this set at this workload", never "fastest part that exists". That is the
  right frame: the set is already budget- and compatibility-filtered, so the
  question is only ever which of *these* to buy.
