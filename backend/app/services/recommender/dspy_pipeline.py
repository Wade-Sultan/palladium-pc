"""
dspy_pipeline.py
================
Central DSPy pipeline orchestrator.

Invoked once the frontend has collected use cases, budget, and Q&A answers.
Runs components in dependency order, passing each decision into the next
as a hard constraint.

Dependency order:
    DDR → CPU → Cooler → Motherboard → RAM → Storage → GPU → PSU → Case → Fans

Budget allocation:
    _allocate_budget() derives per-slot ceilings from the total budget.
    These are independent soft maximums passed to the DB query layer — they
    don't have to sum to the total budget (ram/storage in particular are
    sized generously since not every slot maxes out at once), and they
    don't prevent the LLM from picking a cheaper option (and it should,
    often).

Status messages:
    Each step emits one stable, user-facing progress message up front (before
    the DB query) via _emit(). DSPy's own per-callback sub-messages
    (module_start / lm_start) are intentionally swallowed (_noop_status) so the
    frontend keeps showing that one message for the whole step instead of
    flickering — e.g. "Building your PC…" stays put through the entire DDR step
    and only changes when the next step begins.
    The pipeline is fully async — await run_pipeline() from an async context.

      - DSPy-native messages (module_start, lm_start) from BuildStatusProvider,
