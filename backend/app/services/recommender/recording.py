"""
recording.py
============
Best-effort telemetry for the DSPy recommender pipeline.

A `BuildRecorder` accumulates one `build_sessions` row plus one
`module_decisions` row per `Decide*` call, then hands the lot to a write-behind
buffer on Valkey. `drain_pending()`, called from turn_runner after save_turn,
and by the telemetry-drain job, is what actually writes them to Postgres.

WHY THE BUFFER IS IN THE MIDDLE. The recorder is driven from inside a LangGraph
node, and that path may read from Postgres but never write to it; persistence is
save_turn's job, outside the graph. Recording used to commit directly from the
`build` node, which both broke that rule and made a re-executed node emit a
second build_sessions row rather than overwriting the first. See
app/services/telemetry_buffer.py.

Writes are still fire-and-forget: any failure is logged and swallowed so
recording can never block or fail a user's build.

The per-decision snapshot is captured *verbatim* (candidate set, input state,
prompt hash) so a GEPA replay months later isn't corrupted by drift in
pc_parts pricing/inventory.

If a pipeline run has no recorder, none of this runs: zero behavior change.
