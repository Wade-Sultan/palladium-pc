"""Per-request OpenRouter blocker for load tests.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Locust driving /chat would otherwise make real OpenRouter calls:
profile extraction, elicitation, recommendation, and one LM call per build
step. A few hundred simulated users is real money, spent to learn nothing about
the LLM. This stubs the two places the service talks to OpenRouter so a load test
exercises everything else for real (routing, auth, Postgres, SSE framing,
telemetry) while making zero outbound LLM calls.

HOW IT IS TRIGGERED. A request carrying `X-Palladium-Load-Test: <secret>` is
served with stub LMs. Everything else, every real user, takes the normal path
and reaches OpenRouter. That is what lets a load test run against the real
production deployment rather than a parallel copy of it.

SAFE BY DEFAULT. The secret comes from LOAD_TEST_SECRET, which is unset in
normal deployments; while it is unset the header is ignored entirely, so the
stub cannot be reached even by someone who guesses the header name. Comparison
is constant-time. The worst a leaked secret buys an attacker is a fake
recommendation for themselves, it grants no data access and spends nothing,
but it is still a credential, so it lives in palladium-secrets-builder rather
than in the ConfigMap.

WHERE THE STUBS ATTACH. Exactly two chokepoints, both on the async request path
where this ContextVar is reliably set:
  * chat_pipeline._get_client()        the streaming OpenAI/OpenRouter client
  * dspy_pipeline.session_lm()         every DSPy module call
Nothing else in the service makes an outbound LLM call.

IT HAS TO CROSS PUB/SUB. In any deployment with Valkey and Pub/Sub configured,
which is to say production, /chat does not run the turn at all: it publishes to
a topic and relays the worker's stream back. The worker is a different pod in a
different process, so a ContextVar set by this middleware means nothing there,
and every LM call of a load-tested turn would be real. The flag therefore
travels in the message body (routes/chat.py sets `load_test`) and is re-entered
on the far side with load_test_scope() (worker.py). Without that hop the two
chokepoints above are simply never reached under load.
