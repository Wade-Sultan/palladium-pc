"""Valkey (Memorystore) connection management.

Valkey speaks the Redis wire protocol, so this is redis-py throughout. There is
no separate client library, and `import redis` here is not a mistake.

CLUSTER MODE MUST MATCH THE INSTANCE, and getting it wrong is the most likely way
to lose an afternoon, because the two mismatches fail in opposite directions:

  Redis client -> clustered instance   Connects fine, then dies on the first key
                                       that hashes outside the node it reached,
                                       with a MOVED error surfacing as an
                                       unrelated-looking exception mid-turn.
  RedisCluster -> non-clustered        Fails at connect: there is no CLUSTER
                                       SLOTS to read.

`VALKEY_CLUSTER` defaults to False, which is correct for both real deployments.
Production runs a `custom-pico` node, the smallest node type Google sells with
an SLA, and one they offer on **Cluster Mode Disabled instances only**, and local
dev runs a standalone valkey container. (`shared-core-nano` is cheaper and does
speak the cluster protocol, but it has no SLA and Google documents it as
development-only.)

Nothing here depends on the non-clustered shape. The key layout in
app/services/turn_stream.py is already cluster-safe, so moving to a Cluster Mode
Enabled instance later is a config flip rather than a rewrite.

DEGRADES RATHER THAN CRASHES. Every accessor returns None when Valkey is
unconfigured or unreachable, and callers treat that as "no buffering, no resume"
instead of an error. Losing the ability to resume a stream should not take the
API down with it.

# TWO clients, and the split is not an optimisation. It is a correctness fix.
#
# redis-py enforces `socket_timeout` on every read, INCLUDING the read that is
# deliberately parked by a blocking command. XREAD BLOCK 15000 against a stream
# nothing has written to yet is a 15-second read by design, so a 5-second socket
# timeout aborts it every time: redis-py raises TimeoutError (a RedisError),
# retries the command a few times, and eventually gives up, about 60 seconds of
# nothing, surfaced to the caller as an error rather than as "no events yet".
#
# HOW THIS HID FOR SO LONG. turn_stream.tail() is the only blocking reader, and
# until the worker pool gained a scale-to-zero floor there was always a warm
# worker that wrote its first event within a few hundred milliseconds: well
# inside 5 seconds, so the block never ran long enough to trip the timeout. The
# first cold start made every /chat fail with "That build didn't start", because
# the tail now genuinely has to wait out the pod coming up. The bug was always
# here; the warm floor was paying for it.
#
# So the ordinary client keeps the tight 5s guard, which is right for the short
# commands that make up everything else (XADD, SCAN, GET, DEL), and blocking
# readers get their own client whose socket timeout is longer than the block
# they issue.
#
# Two pools, not two connection counts: redis-py creates connections lazily, so
# the second pool costs nothing in a process that never issues a blocking read,
# which is every process except the API pods serving SSE.

# turn_stream.tail() checks its own idle_timeout_ms against this at call time
# rather than trusting the two numbers to be edited together.
#
# 30s against tail()'s 15s block leaves the whole margin to spare. It is still a
# bound: a partition parks a blocking reader for 30 seconds, not forever, which
# is the property the 5s timeout exists to provide for ordinary commands.

    decision is made on configuration alone, then a builder pod that cannot
    reach Valkey will still publish to Pub/Sub, the worker picks the turn up,
    runs it, bills OpenRouter and commits it to Postgres, all perfectly, while
    the pod holding the browser connection has no way to read the events back.
    The user gets an empty response, and nothing in either pod's log says why,
    because nothing failed.

    Checking reachability first means that pod falls back to inline streaming
    instead: the turn still works, it just isn't durable across a disconnect.
