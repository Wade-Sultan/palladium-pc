"""OpenTelemetry tracing: one SDK, two destinations.

    spans ──┬─► OTLP to $OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT ──► Google Cloud Observability
            │   (Managed OpenTelemetry for GKE injects that variable)
            └─► OTLP to LangSmith, scope-filtered ─────► LangSmith

WHY TWO PIPES RATHER THAN A COLLECTOR FAN-OUT. Managed OpenTelemetry for GKE
cannot export to third-party backends, it writes to Google Cloud Observability
and nowhere else, and it owns OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT in the pod, so it
cannot be pointed at LangSmith either. Reaching both means either self-hosting a
collector that fans out, or attaching a second span processor here. This is the
second, which costs no infrastructure to run.

WHY THE LANGSMITH PIPE IS FILTERED. Everything the process traces goes to Google:
FastAPI request spans, Cloud SQL spans, Pub/Sub spans. LangSmith is an LLM
observability tool billed by what you send it, and a chat turn's HTTP span tells
it nothing it can use. So only spans from the LLM and graph instrumentation
scopes take that exit. Cloud Trace still sees all of them.

EVERY PIECE IS INDEPENDENTLY OPTIONAL. No OTLP endpoint, no Google pipe. No
LangSmith key, no LangSmith pipe. Neither configured, and configure_tracing() is
a no-op that leaves the global provider alone. Local development and the test
suite hit that last case, and must keep working exactly as they did.
