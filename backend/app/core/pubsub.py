"""Pub/Sub publisher for chat turn requests.

WHAT CROSSES THIS BOUNDARY. Only a request to run a turn, never the turn's
output. Events go to Valkey (app/services/turn_stream.py), because Pub/Sub cannot
deliver to a browser and its at-least-once redelivery would duplicate tokens
mid-sentence. This topic is the control plane; the stream is the data plane.

ORDERING KEY IS THE CONVERSATION ID. Two turns published for one conversation
must run in order or the second will read a message history the first has not
finished writing. Ordering keys give per-key FIFO with no global bottleneck, so
unrelated conversations still run fully in parallel. Note that ordering requires
the publisher and subscription to agree. The subscription must be created with
`--enable-message-ordering` or the guarantee is silently lost.

THE PUBLISHER CLIENT IS SYNC AND THREADED. google-cloud-pubsub has no asyncio
publisher; `publish()` returns a concurrent.futures.Future resolved on its own
thread. Awaiting that future directly would block the event loop, so publish()
below hands it to the running loop via asyncio.wrap_future.
