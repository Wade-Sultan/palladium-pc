    cannot silently differ between the sync and async engines.

    Refusing when both are set is the point. CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE used to win
    unconditionally, so exporting POSTGRES_DB_URL to aim a script at a scratch
    database did nothing at all and the script wrote to Cloud SQL instead,
    with no error and no log line saying which target it picked. That is a bad
    way to find out, and every environment here sets exactly one of the two:
    GKE and docker-compose.dev pass POSTGRES_DB_URL only, a bare-metal local
    checkout has CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE only. Two contradictory instructions is a
    mistake, not a preference to resolve silently.

    DB_TARGET is the way to resolve it deliberately. It is needed because
    Settings sets env_ignore_empty=True, so blanking one of the two on the
    command line does nothing. The .env value survives, and the obvious
    workaround silently fails.
