"""Stub LMs used when a request opts into load-test mode.

Both stubs are local and make no network calls of any kind. That is the whole
point. See app/core/loadtest.py for how a request is routed here.

They deliberately imitate the *shape* of the real thing rather than returning
instantly: an LM that answers in 0ms would make a load test measure a service
that does not exist. The delays below are crude but keep concurrency, SSE
framing and connection-holding behaviour in the right ballpark. Tune with
LOAD_TEST_STUB_TTFT_MS / LOAD_TEST_STUB_TOKEN_MS; set both to 0 to measure pure
service overhead with the LM removed entirely.
