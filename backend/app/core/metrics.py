"""Prometheus metrics for the builder service.

SCRAPED, NOT PUSHED. Google Managed Prometheus scrapes this endpoint via the
`PodMonitoring` resource in deploy/overlays/prod/podmonitoring.yaml and stores
the series in Cloud Monitoring, which is where they are queried from. Nothing
here pushes anywhere.

WHY A SEPARATE PORT. The metrics endpoint listens on METRICS_PORT, not on the
API port, and that port is deliberately absent from the Service. Both
HTTPRoutes in deploy/base/ have a rule with no `matches:`, which in Gateway API
means "match every path", so a /metrics mounted on the API app would be served
straight to the public internet, publishing every route name, request count and
latency distribution the service has. GMP scrapes pod IPs directly and never
goes through the Service or the Gateway, so a port that exists only on the pod
is scrapeable while staying unroutable from outside.
