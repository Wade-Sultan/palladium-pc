"""Domain metrics for chat turns, separate from HTTP instrumentation.

app/core/metrics.py instruments the *framework*, request rates, latencies,
in-flight counts, which is the same set any FastAPI service would want. These
are about what a turn does, and most of them only ever move on the worker.

WHY THESE FOUR. Each one exists to answer a question that the HTTP metrics
cannot, because the work no longer happens inside a request:

  turn_commits_total{result}   Did the turn reach Postgres? A failed commit is
                               invisible from the API side: the user saw their
                               build, the stream terminated normally, and only
                               this counter and a retained buffer record that
                               nothing was written.
  chat_buffers_retained        How many turns are sitting unpersisted right now.
                               The counter above catches the event; this catches
                               the backlog, including events missed while an
                               alert was silenced.
  turn_duration_seconds        How long turns take once dequeued. builder's
                               request histogram measures time-to-first-byte
                               (should_exclude_streaming_duration=True), so it
                               says nothing about total build time.
  turns_inflight               Worker saturation. The CPU-based signal
                               understates it for the same reason it does on
                               builder: turns block on OpenRouter, not on CPU.

Registered on the default registry, so the exporter in app/core/metrics.py
serves them with no extra wiring and GMP scrapes them through the same
PodMonitoring.
