"""Process-local readiness flag for the DSPy/litellm warm-up.

Lives in its own module, not in chat_pipeline, so the readiness probe can
import it without dragging in the pipeline's import chain, which is the very
cost the warm-up exists to keep off the request path.

Set via threading.Event because the warm-up itself runs under
asyncio.to_thread, so the flag is written from a worker thread and read from
the event loop.
