# "Tell me when this gets cheaper." The alerts themselves are fired by the
# pricing ETL (app/services/pricing_etl/alerts.py) and delivered by commerce;
# these routes only manage who is waiting for what.
#
# The bell on each build-card part row is the client (frontend
# components/assistant-ui/price-alert.tsx), with the settings page listing what
# a user is watching. Dispatch is separately gated by
# settings.PRICE_ALERTS_ENABLED, so subscribing is safe before that is on: rows
# are recorded and evaluated, and no mail leaves the cluster.
#
# Every target the client names is a pc_parts id, because that is the only
# identifier a build carries: resolve_price_target redirects the grouped types
# to the row the ETL actually prices, so what gets stored is always watchable.
