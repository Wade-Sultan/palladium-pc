"""A publicly shareable snapshot of a generated build.

WHY A SNAPSHOT AND NOT A JOIN. The build a conversation produced lives in
message metadata, which is private to the conversation's owner and shaped by
whatever the pipeline emitted that day. A share link has the opposite needs:
readable by anyone holding the token, and frozen. The page and the PDF someone
shares must keep saying what they said when they were shared, even after
catalogs, prices, or the pipeline move on. So the row copies the build payload
outright rather than referencing anything that can drift.

The token is the only credential: unguessable (secrets.token_urlsafe), carried
in the URL, and granting access to nothing but this snapshot. `conversation_id`
is a plain column, not a foreign key, because the row is written mid-turn,
before _save_turn has necessarily created the conversation, and for guest
turns the conversation never comes to exist at all.
