embeddings.py
=============
One table holding every vector in the system: catalog entities (games,
software, AI models) and parts alike.

WHY ONE TABLE RATHER THAN ONE PER TYPE. A `cpu_vectors` / `gpu_vectors` /
`game_vectors` split gives identical query plans to this once a partial index
per type exists (see below), and costs a nine-file Alembic revision every time
the embedding model or its dimension count changes. Embedding models get
swapped far more often than parts schemas do, so the axis worth optimizing for
is "re-embed everything cheaply", not "keep each type's rows apart".

WHY THERE IS NO FOREIGN KEY. `entity_id` addresses nine different tables,
pc_parts subclasses, the four group tables (which are NOT under pc_parts), and
three catalog tables. Postgres has no FK that can target a union of tables, so
referential integrity here is maintained by the sweep in
app/services/embeddings/store.py rather than by the database. That sweep deletes
rows whose entity has disappeared; until it runs, an orphan is inert: searches
join back to the source table and a missing join simply drops the row.

WHY EMBEDDINGS SIT ON GROUPS, NOT EXACTS. For GPU/RAM/PSU/Storage the intrinsic
spec lives on the group and the exacts differ only in brand, price and physical
dimensions: none of which carry semantic meaning worth a vector. Embedding
every board of an RTX 5080 would store twenty near-identical vectors that all
match the same query and then have to be deduped back down to the chipset. So
`entity_type` for those is the group ('gpu_chipset', 'ram_group', ...), matching
how the recommender already reasons about them.

STALENESS IS CONTENT-ADDRESSED. `source_hash` is a SHA-256 of the exact text
that produced the vector. Re-embedding is therefore a pure function of the row's
current content: build the text, hash it, compare. That is what lets the
reconcile sweep pick up newly-inserted parts and edited rows without a creation
hook in every write path, including the admin app's Prisma writes, which the
backend never sees.
