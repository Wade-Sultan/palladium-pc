# Parts the listings API could not produce a listing for.
#
# Written by commerce (internal/store/store.go), not by anything here. The
# listings API is the only thing that knows a lookup failed. The model exists in
# the builder because app/models is the schema mirror Alembic autogenerates
# against; without it, the next `alembic revision --autogenerate` would propose
# dropping this table.
#
# Current state, not an event log: one row per part, keyed by part_id, with a
# counter. The build card fetches listings per part on every render, so a single
# part with no listing is hit dozens of times a day. An append-only log would
# be almost entirely duplicates, and the digest email built on it would be
# unreadable.

# A part that exists and is recommended, but has nothing active to buy. A
# coverage gap: the fix is to add a listing.
