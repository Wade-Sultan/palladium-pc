# Price alerts: a user asks to be told when a part gets cheaper, and the pricing
# ETL (app/services/pricing_etl/) is what decides whether that has happened,
# it is the only thing in the system that ever moves street_price_cents, so it
# is the only place where "the price changed" is a fact rather than a guess.
#
# Targets are the same (target_kind, target_id) pair price_checks uses, NOT an
# FK to pc_parts: street_price_cents lives on pc_parts for cpu/motherboard/case/
# cooler/fan and on the group tables for gpu/psu/ram/storage, so a subscription
# has to be able to point at either. See app/crud/pricing_etl.py::TARGET_MODELS
# for the mapping, which is shared rather than duplicated for exactly this
# reason.

# Terminal once notified: an alert fires at most once per subscription. A user
# who wants to keep watching a part re-subscribes, which starts a fresh row with
# a fresh baseline, otherwise a part oscillating around a threshold would mail
# them on every run that nudged it back down.
