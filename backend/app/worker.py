"""Pub/Sub subscriber that runs chat turns off the request path.

Runs as its own Deployment (deploy/base/worker/), from the same image as the API
with a different command. Same image on purpose: the pipeline, the models and the
DSPy configuration are all shared, and a separate image would let the two drift
apart while looking identical in the repo.

THREADING MODEL, which is the only genuinely awkward part of this file.
google-cloud-pubsub's streaming pull has no asyncio interface: `subscribe()`
dispatches each message to a callback on its own thread pool. The turn pipeline
is thoroughly async. So this module owns an event loop on the main thread, and
each callback thread hands its coroutine over with
`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` and blocks on the result before acking. That
block is deliberate. The callback thread's lifetime is what Pub/Sub's flow
control counts, so blocking it is what makes `max_messages` an actual
concurrency ceiling rather than a polite suggestion.

ACK SEMANTICS. Ack on success and on permanent failure; nack on transient
failure so it comes back. A turn that raised inside the pipeline is *not*
transient, run_turn already caught it, emitted an apology and terminated the
stream, so redelivering it would only spend more OpenRouter budget arriving at
the same answer. Only infrastructure failures nack.
