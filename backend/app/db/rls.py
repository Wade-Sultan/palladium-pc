class RLSPolicy:

    Describes a single RLS policy.

    Attributes:
        name:       Unique policy name (within the table).
        table:      Table the policy applies to.
        command:    SQL command(s) the policy covers.
        using:      USING expression. Filters which *existing* rows are visible.
        with_check: WITH CHECK expression. Filters which rows can be *written*.
                    Defaults to the USING expression if not specified.
        role:       Postgres role the policy targets. Defaults to 'authenticated'
                    (Supabase's role for logged-in users).
        schema:     Schema the table lives in. Defaults to 'public'.
        permissive: Whether the policy is PERMISSIVE (default) or RESTRICTIVE.
