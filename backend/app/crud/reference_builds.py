    """How much the reference builds cost NOW versus their curated snapshots.

    WHY A SINGLE RATIO RATHER THAN A PRICE PER TIER. The obvious move is to
    anchor each budget tier to the live total of the reference build that tier
    resolves to. It does not work: resolve_build maps several tiers onto one
    build (entry and mid 1440p gaming are both '1440_mid'), so anchoring
    directly would silently collapse tiers that today differ by $500 and would
    hand a server profile whatever the two server builds happen to cost. The
    ladder's *shape* — the spacing between tiers, and the server ladder sitting
    above the desktop one — is hand-tuned and worth keeping.

    So this measures only what the constants cannot know: which direction the
    market has moved since someone last reviewed them. Callers scale the whole
    ladder by it, preserving every relative decision while the absolute level
    tracks the catalog.

    The median across builds, not the mean: one reference build holding a part
    that has gone end-of-life and spiked should not drag every tier up with it.

    Returns None when nothing can be measured (no active builds, no live prices
    backfilled, a query failure) — callers then use the constants unscaled,
    which is exactly today's behaviour.
