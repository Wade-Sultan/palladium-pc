"""Scheduled job entrypoint: `python -m app.jobs.telemetry_drain`.

Backstop for the build-telemetry write-behind buffer. In the normal case
turn_runner drains it at the end of every turn, so this finds nothing. Its
reason to exist is the cases turn_runner cannot cover:

  - a worker that was SIGTERM'd between the recorder's buffer write and the
    drain at the end of its turn,
  - a period where Postgres was unreachable and every in-turn drain gave up
    leaving entries behind,
  - the tail of a backlog too large for the per-turn batch to clear.

Reuses the backend image; the CronJob only overrides the container command,
exactly like app.jobs.discovery and app.jobs.pricing_etl.

Costs no LLM tokens: this moves rows that were already paid for at build time.
