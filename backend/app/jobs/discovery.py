"""Scheduled job entrypoint: `python -m app.jobs.discovery`.

Gap-fill pass over the review queue. Picks up pending discovered_items whose
last extraction failed validation and re-runs discovery for each, giving the
extractor a fresh set of sources. The partial unique index
(uq_discovered_items_pending_cat_name) means a re-run refreshes the existing
pending row via ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE rather than stacking duplicates.

Reuses the backend image; the CronJob only overrides the container command,
exactly like app.jobs.pricing_etl.

Bounded by DISCOVERY_MAX_ITEMS because every item costs LLM calls: three
sources fetched and extracted per item, billed through OpenRouter. Items are
processed one at a time. _run already fans out across sources internally, and
serialising at this level keeps search-API rate limits and spend predictable.
