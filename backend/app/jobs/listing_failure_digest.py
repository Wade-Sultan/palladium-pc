"""Cloud Run Job / CronJob entrypoint: `python -m app.jobs.listing_failure_digest`.

Asks commerce to mail the operator about parts the listings API could not
produce a listing for, then exits. Reuses the backend's own Docker image, no
separate Dockerfile, the Job resource just overrides the container's
command/args, exactly like the pricing ETL.

This job holds no logic of its own on purpose. Commerce records the failures,
owns the email credential and the templates, and reads the same database, so it
does the whole thing; what it cannot do is decide *when*, because it runs more
than one replica and an in-process timer would send one digest per pod. That
decision is this job, and the CronJob schedule behind it.
