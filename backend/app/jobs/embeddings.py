"""Scheduled job entrypoint: `python -m app.jobs.embeddings`.

Reconciles the `embeddings` table against the catalog and parts tables: embeds
anything new, re-embeds anything whose descriptive text changed, and deletes
vectors whose entity is gone.

WHY A SCHEDULED SWEEP RATHER THAN A WRITE HOOK. Rows reach this database from
the discovery pipeline, the admin app's Prisma writes, and hand-run SQL, and
only the first goes through the backend at all. A create hook would cover that
one path and silently miss the others. Reconciliation is content-addressed
(see services/embeddings/store.py), so it picks up every write no matter who
made it.

CHEAP WHEN IDLE, which is what makes a frequent schedule reasonable: an
unchanged catalog costs one indexed SELECT per entity type and zero API calls.
Cost scales with churn, not with catalog size.

Runs to completion and exits, reusing the backend image with an overridden
command: same shape as app.jobs.discovery and app.jobs.ai_models.
