"""Scheduled job entrypoint: `python -m app.jobs.benchmarks`.

Fills `benchmark_scores` on CPUs and GPU chipsets that don't have them, so the
recommender's scorer has real numbers to rank candidates on.

WHY COVERAGE MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. services/recommender/scoring.py injects
a workload-weighted perf_score into every CPU and GPU candidate list, and its
dominance gate, the thing that lets a step skip its LLM call, refuses to fire
unless *every* candidate in the set is scored. One unmeasured chipset inside a
budget band therefore disables the bypass for every build that lands in that
band. Chasing coverage to 100% is what switches the saving on.

COSTS REAL MONEY per part: one Tavily search plus up to three fetch+extract
calls. DISCOVERY_BENCHMARK_LIMIT caps how many parts one run will attempt, and
the run is recorded in discovery_runs like any other, so the spend is visible
next to the sweeps rather than hidden in a cron log.

Idempotent by construction. It only ever selects rows whose benchmark_scores
is NULL or {}, so re-running costs nothing once coverage is complete.
