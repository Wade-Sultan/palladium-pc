"""Scheduled job entrypoint: `python -m app.jobs.ai_models`.

Monthly Hugging Face Hub sweep. Stages whatever the Hub is currently trending
that the ai_models catalog doesn't already have, into the same review queue the
hardware categories use: nothing reaches ai_models without a human approving
it in the admin panel.

Reuses the backend image; the CronJob only overrides the container command,
exactly like app.jobs.discovery and app.jobs.pricing_etl.

Unlike the hardware jobs this costs no LLM tokens at all: the Hub publishes
these fields as structured JSON, so there is nothing to extract. The bound in
DISCOVERY_SWEEP_MAX_CANDIDATES still applies, but as a cap on how much a
reviewer is handed at once rather than on spend.
