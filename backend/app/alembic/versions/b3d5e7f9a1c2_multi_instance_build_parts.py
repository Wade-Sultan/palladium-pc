"""allow a build to hold several GPUs, drives and fans

pc_build_parts carried a table-wide UNIQUE (build_id, role), which made "one
part per role" a schema-level fact. That is right for the CPU, board, cooler,
PSU and case, and wrong for the three roles a server build is actually defined
by: a machine built to serve LLMs hosts several GPUs, splits storage between a
fast boot drive and bulk capacity, and buys fans per case slot.

The constraint was already costing data. admin/src/app/reference-builds
collects multiple GPU chipsets, storage groups and fans, then dropped all but
the first when writing pc_build_parts because a second row could not be
inserted.

Replaces the one constraint with four, so the guarantee is narrowed rather
than removed:
  - singleton roles keep exactly the old uniqueness
  - the same part cannot be listed twice within one role (use quantity)
  - quantity is at least 1
  - quantity is exactly 1 for singleton roles, so a second CPU is not
    expressible as quantity=2 either
