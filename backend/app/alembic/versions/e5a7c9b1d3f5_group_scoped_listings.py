"""listings can target a part group, not just one part

An eBay listing is a filtered search URL, and a search for "RTX 3090" is right
for every partner board of that chipset. There is nothing board-specific in it
to get wrong. Before this, one had to be entered per pc_parts row, which meant
re-entering the same URL for each board and missing every board added later.

A listing now points at exactly one of five things: a part, or one of the four
groups the catalog already models (gpu_chipsets, psu_groups, ram_groups,
storage_groups: the same groups that carry street_price_cents for the same
reason). The CHECK constraint enforces "exactly one", so a row cannot mean two
things or nothing.

Group columns live here rather than in a listings_by_group table on purpose:
the row-level security added in d4e6f8a0b2c3 is attached to `listings`, so a
group listing is covered by the same policies with no further work. A second
table would have been a second thing to remember to protect, and the one it
would hold is eBay data.

Resolution (commerce/internal/store/store.go) prefers a part's own listing over
its group's, so a specific row still overrides the generic one.
