"""normalize_reference_build_pricing_cents

reference_builds.total_approx / reference_build_parts.approx_price are
supposed to be cents (same convention as every other *_cents column, see
chat_pipeline.py's _assemble_dspy_build docstring and build-card.tsx's
unconditional `total_approx / 100`). seed_reference_builds.py used to write
them un-multiplied (dollars) while the admin UI (reference-builds/actions.ts)
has always written them correctly in cents. So today this table has a mix:
rows never touched since seeding are dollar-scale, rows edited via admin are
cents-scale, in the same columns.

This normalizes existing rows still sitting at dollar-scale up to cents.
Classification happens at the build level (not per-part): observed
dollar-scale build totals top out around $12,000, so even the cheapest
dollar-scale build misread as cents (110,000+) is nowhere near a real
cents-scale total. There's no overlap risk at that granularity, unlike
individual part prices which can plausibly land in either range. Each
build's parts are updated using the SAME classification as their parent
build (before the build row itself is updated), since a single admin edit
writes a build's total and all its parts' prices together in one cents-scale
mutation.
