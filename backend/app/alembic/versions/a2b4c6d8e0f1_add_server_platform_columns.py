"""add server-platform columns and AI-model discovery links

Two things the "server" use case needs that the consumer-desktop schema never
had to carry:

1. Server-platform spec. What separates a Threadripper/Xeon/EPYC build from a
   consumer one is not clock speed, it is PCIe lanes (how many GPUs and NVMe
   drives can run at full width), memory channels (bandwidth, which is the
   binding constraint for HPC and CPU-side inference), and ECC/registered
   memory. None of those were expressible, so the recommender could pick a
   Threadripper by name but could not reason about why anyone would want one.

2. AI-model discovery links. discovered_items could only point at pc_parts and
   gpu_chipsets. ai_models is neither, so an approved AI model had nowhere to
   record its dedup match or its audit link back to the created row.
