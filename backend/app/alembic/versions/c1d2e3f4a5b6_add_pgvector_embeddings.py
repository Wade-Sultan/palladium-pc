"""enable pgvector and add the unified embeddings table

Adds semantic search over two things:

  * The catalog side: games, software and AI models. This is the half that
    earns its keep: BuildProfile.games / .workloads arrive as free text
    ("Arc Raiders", "DaVinci Resolve", "Llama 70B") with unbounded vocabulary,
    misspellings and abbreviations, and until now reached the pipeline only as
    prose inside a prompt. Matching them to catalog rows attaches the
    requirement data those rows carry (game_minimum_parts, software_tiers,
    ai_workloads), none of which the recommender previously read.
  * The parts side: one vector per part or part *group*, for text search over
    the catalog ("quiet white ITX case").

ONE TABLE, PARTIAL INDEXES. Every vector lives in `embeddings`, discriminated
by entity_type. HNSW cannot filter efficiently inside a single shared index,
it would return k nearest overall and then throw away everything of the wrong
type, so each entity_type gets its own partial HNSW index. That gives the same
plan a per-type table would, while keeping a model swap to one ALTER.

COSINE, NOT L2. text-embedding-3-small returns normalized vectors, where cosine
distance and L2 rank identically; cosine is chosen because it stays correct if a
future model returns unnormalized output, and because its 0..2 range makes
distance thresholds portable across models.

    # it was created through the Cloud SQL API/gcloud rather than with plain
    # CREATE USER. Rather than depend on that, pre-create the extension once per
    # database as an admin user:
    #
    #   psql -U postgres -d <db> -c 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;'

    # This statement then becomes a no-op the app user is allowed to run. Also
    # verified: with the extension already present it returns CREATE EXTENSION
    # plus a "already exists, skipping" NOTICE, with no privilege check. Which
    # is what makes this line safe to leave in the migration either way.
