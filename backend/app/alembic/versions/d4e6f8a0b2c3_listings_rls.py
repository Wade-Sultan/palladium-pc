"""row-level security on listings. Admin writes, commerce reads, builder neither

Makes the affiliate-data boundary the /about page describes an enforced one
rather than a convention. Three roles, three levels of access to `listings`
and its two subtype tables:

    palladium_admin      full read/write   (admin, via Prisma)
    palladium_commerce   read only         (commerce, via pgx)
    palladium_app        no access at all  (builder / worker / cron jobs)

The builder's exclusion is the point. eBay Partner Network's agreement bars
eBay data from reaching an AI system, and the builder is the service that runs
the DSPy pipeline and writes the GEPA telemetry dataset, so the guarantee is
worth more coming from the database than from a code review. Nothing in the
builder reads `listings` any more (the Amazon URL lookup in
crud/reference_builds.py was removed in the same change); the frontend resolves
marketplace links from commerce's live listings instead.

RLS is FORCEd so it applies to the tables' owner too, not just to other roles.
Note the residual hole that leaves: whichever role owns these tables can still
DROP POLICY or set NO FORCE. Ownership currently sits with the migration role,
so this stops accidental reads, a future query in the builder returns nothing,
rather than a determined one. Moving ownership to palladium_admin closes it,
at the cost of listings DDL no longer running under the builder's role.

    """Make sure the three roles exist, creating them where that is allowed.

    Two environments, two right answers. Under docker-compose, CI, Tilt, a
    local database, POSTGRES_USER is palladium_app and it is the container's
    superuser, so the roles can simply be created and the migration is testable
    like any other. On Cloud SQL palladium_app has no CREATEROLE, and the
    passwords have to come from the secret store rather than from here, so the
    only useful thing this can do is stop with instructions.

    Roles created here are NOLOGIN and passwordless on purpose: enough to be a
    policy grantee, not enough to be an account. Granting them LOGIN and a
    password is a deliberate operator step, never a side effect of a migration.

    One consequence worth knowing: under compose, palladium_app is the
    container's superuser, and a superuser passes every privilege check and
    bypasses RLS. So the boundary does NOT bite locally. A query added to the
    builder that reads `listings` will work on a dev machine and fail in prod,
    where palladium_app is an ordinary role. Verify the lockout against the
    real database, not this one.
