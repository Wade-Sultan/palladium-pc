"""ensure pc_parts pricing columns exist (repair schema drift)

The pricing columns were introduced in 1d9f3b7c2a44, but some databases have
that revision marked applied in alembic_version without the columns actually
present (schema drift). The polymorphic PCPart load then fails with
'column pc_parts.msrp_cents does not exist'. Because Alembic considers
1d9f3b7c2a44 applied, it won't re-run it, so this migration idempotently
re-adds any missing pricing column. It's a no-op on a correctly-migrated DB.
