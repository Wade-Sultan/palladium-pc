"""add catalog_requirements to module_decisions

Makes the appropriateness metrics' sufficiency term measurable.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. services/recommender/appropriateness.py scores a part
choice as sufficiency * efficiency, where sufficiency asks whether the part
clears the hardware floors the user's named games / software / AI models imply.
Those floors were computed per build by catalog_match and folded into the
prompt as prose, and then discarded. So scoring a recorded decision could only
ever measure price efficiency, and reported sufficiency as an explicitly missing
signal rather than a number.

WHY A COLUMN RATHER THAN A KEY IN input_state. input_state is the verbatim
snapshot of the arguments the DSPy signature received, and it is what a GEPA
replay reads back to rebuild an Example. An extra key there would become a
phantom input field on replay, present in the recorded state, absent from the
signature, so the requirements get their own column instead.

WHY SNAPSHOT AT ALL RATHER THAN RECOMPUTE. The floors come from catalogs and
embeddings that keep moving: games get patched, tiers get edited, the embedding
model gets swapped. Recomputing months later would score a decision against a
yardstick the model never saw, which is the same reasoning that already makes
candidate_set a verbatim snapshot rather than a set of foreign keys.

BACKFILL IS IMPOSSIBLE and deliberately not attempted. The floors for a past
build depended on what the user named in that conversation and on the catalog as
it stood then; neither is recoverable. Existing rows stay NULL, and
scripts/score_appropriateness.py reports them as uninformative rather than
scoring them as if sufficiency had been checked and passed.
