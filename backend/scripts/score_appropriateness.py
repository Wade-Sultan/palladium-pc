"""Score recorded build decisions with the appropriateness metrics.

    uv run python scripts/score_appropriateness.py [--limit N] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]
    uv run python scripts/score_appropriateness.py --worst 15
    uv run python scripts/score_appropriateness.py --category gpu --json out.json

WHY THIS RUNS OFFLINE RATHER THAN NEEDING A COLLECTION CAMPAIGN. module_decisions
stores `candidate_set` as a verbatim JSONB snapshot of exactly what the model was
shown, plus the chosen name and the input state. The appropriateness metrics are
pure functions of those, so every build already recorded can be scored right
now. The eval set is the production history.

READ THE COVERAGE REPORT BEFORE THE SCORES. The metrics degrade rather than fail
when a signal is missing, and two signals arrived recently:

  * `perf_score` on candidate rows: added when scoring.py landed. Decisions
    recorded before then have candidate sets without it.
  * requirement floors (min_vram_gb, min_cores). These come from catalog_match
    resolving what the user named, which needs embeddings backfilled AND the
    user to have named something matchable.

A decision scored with neither is being judged almost entirely on price, and the
report says so rather than averaging it in silently. A high mean over
low-coverage rows means nothing.

NOTHING HERE WRITES. Safe to run against production.
