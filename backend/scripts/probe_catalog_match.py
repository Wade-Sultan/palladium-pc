"""Probe what the catalog actually matches for a phrase a user might type.

    uv run python scripts/probe_catalog_match.py "R6" "Tarkov" "Resolve"
    uv run python scripts/probe_catalog_match.py --top 5 "llama 70b"

WHY THIS EXISTS. services/recommender/catalog_match.py accepts a match only
inside _MATCH_MAX_DISTANCE (0.45 cosine), and services/embeddings/store.py's
search defaults to 0.65. Both numbers were picked by judgment, not measurement.
This is how you measure them: run the phrasings your users actually type and
look at where the real match sits versus where the cutoff is.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

  * A correct match ABOVE the cutoff (distance > 0.45) is a silent miss. The
    build proceeds with no requirements attached and nothing anywhere says so.
    Common for abbreviations and community nicknames. The embedded text is
    built from the catalog's own title and genre, so "R6" only resolves to
    Rainbow Six Siege if the embedding model already knew that association.
  * A WRONG match below the cutoff is worse than a miss: it attaches real
    numeric floors to the build under a title the user never named, and those
    numbers then look authoritative in the prompt.
  * Everything clustered around 0.5-0.6 means the cutoff is doing nothing useful
    and the source text in embeddings/text.py needs more to grip.

Costs one embedding call per phrase. Reads only.
