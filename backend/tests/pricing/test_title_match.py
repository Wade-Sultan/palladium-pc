"""Which shopping results count as a listing for the part we searched for.

The disqualifier gate is the interesting half: these titles score *well* on
similarity, they contain the part's full name, which is exactly why a
similarity threshold alone can't keep a $3,499 prebuilt out of a GPU's price.
