"""When a price subscription fires.

Pure-logic tests over alerts.decide: the part with the interesting edges.
Three nullable prices meet an email that can only truthfully say "was $X, now
$Y", so every combination has to resolve to either a real drop or a clean
refusal; commerce rejects a non-drop outright, and a refusal that gets that far
looks like a dispatch failure instead of the deliberate no-op it is.

The rule under all of it is a crossing: above the target before, at or below it
after. A price that was already under the customer's number has nothing to
announce, however far it falls afterwards.
