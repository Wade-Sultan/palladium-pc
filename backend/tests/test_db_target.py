"""
Database target resolution (app.core.db._resolve_db_target).

This exists because of a real incident: CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE used to win
unconditionally, so exporting POSTGRES_DB_URL to aim a migration at a scratch
database did nothing, and the migration ran against Cloud SQL instead: no
error, no log line naming the target. The tests below pin the two properties
that would have prevented it: contradictory settings are refused, and the
escape hatch named in the refusal actually works.
