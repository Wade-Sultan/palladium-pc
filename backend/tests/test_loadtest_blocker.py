These are cost tests, not feature tests. A regression here does not break a
page: it silently bills real OpenRouter tokens for every simulated user in a
load run, which is exactly the kind of failure nobody notices until the
invoice. Hence asserting the negative cases (no header, wrong secret, secret
unset) as carefully as the positive one.
