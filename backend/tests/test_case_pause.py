"""Guards the case pause: the build stops, is saved, and is resumed by a pick.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY AT RISK HERE. Nine LLM-backed decisions happen before the
pause, and the whole point of persisting them is that they are expensive and
unrepeatable. A resume that silently lost a field would produce a *different*
build than the one the user was shown case options for, with no error anywhere.
So the round-trip test below asserts field-by-field equality of the whole state
rather than spot-checking a few attributes.

The claim tests cover the other half: a paused build must be resumable exactly
once, or a double-click produces two builds from one pipeline run.
