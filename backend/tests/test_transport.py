"""Guards the assistant-transport adapter.

WHY REPLAY-FROM-ZERO IS THE THING UNDER TEST. The old SSE adapter streamed
deltas and had the browser accumulate them, so resuming meant Last-Event-ID
bookkeeping on both sides. assistant-transport streams state snapshots instead,
which means a reconnect is just "replay the whole stream and rebuild", and the
tests below exist to keep that property true. If the reader ever starts
depending on what a client already saw, resume quietly stops working for exactly
the case it exists for: a phone that locked during a three-minute build.

WHY THE USER'S OWN MESSAGE IS TESTED AT ALL. It looks like the client's job, and
it is not: the runtime drops its optimistic echo of the message the moment the
first state operation lands, and renders only what state says. A run that never
adds the message leaves the thread empty, which is the condition assistant-ui
puts the welcome screen back on screen for, and the next turn round-trips a
history with no user turns in it, a silent degradation of every elicitation
answer rather than a visible error.

WHY ONE TEST USES THE REAL `create_run`. Operations are deltas against the state
the *client* POSTed; nothing transmits the server's own copy. A fake controller
mutating a plain dict cannot see that distinction, and both real bugs here lived
in it: an index computed against the wrong base, and a `StateProxy` mistaken for
a plain `list`. See `test_the_browser_rebuilds_exactly_what_the_server_holds`.

The event vocabulary these assert against is the one `run_chat_turn` has always
emitted. Nothing in the pipeline knows this layer exists, and these tests are
what keeps that boundary honest.
