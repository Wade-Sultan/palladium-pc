"""Guards the promise that a conversation is recorded in full.

THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. `save_turn` used to count the rows already stored and
slice the incoming conversation at that number: a row count used as a list
index. That holds only while the incoming list is exactly the stored sequence,
and it silently was not: the transport dropped user turns from the state it
round-tripped, so the count ran ahead of the list and the slice came back empty.
Every user message after the first was never written. Nothing raised, nothing
logged; the conversation just came back from history missing half of itself.

So these tests assert the property rather than the mechanism: whatever the user
said and whatever the assistant replied is in the database afterwards, once
each. `messages_to_write` is pure so that property can be checked without a
Postgres, which is why it is a separate function at all.
