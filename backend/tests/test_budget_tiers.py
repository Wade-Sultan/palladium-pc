Budget-tier behaviour: the 'custom' (no ceiling) tier and the server ladder.

Pure-logic tests: no DB, no network. The point of interest is the guard that
stops 'custom' from being reachable by inference alone: it removes every price
ceiling in the pipeline, so it is the one tier where a hallucination is
expensive rather than merely wrong.
