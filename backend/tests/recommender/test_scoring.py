"""
Unit tests for app.services.recommender.scoring.

Pure-logic tests — no DB, no network, no LLM. Two things carry most of the
weight here:

  * The partial-coverage rules. Benchmark data in the catalog is incomplete and
    always will be, so the interesting cases are all about what happens when a
    candidate is missing the axis a workload is decided on.
  * The dominance gate's refusals. A gate that fires when it shouldn't silently
    removes the LLM from a decision that had real judgment in it, and nothing
    downstream would flag that — so each reason it must decline gets its own
    test.
