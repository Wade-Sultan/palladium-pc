"""Editing a message rewrites history rather than appending to it.

WHY THIS NEEDS A TEST AT THE HTTP BOUNDARY. assistant-transport has no "edit"
command. An edit arrives as exactly the same `add-message` any send does, and
the only thing distinguishing it is a sibling `parentId` field naming the
message the new one goes after. So "this is an edit" is a server-side inference
from one field, and every guard around it, the alias that field parses under,
the absent-versus-null distinction, the refusal to rewind on a parent that does
not resolve, is load bearing in a way that unit-testing `rewind_prefix` alone
would not catch. The dangerous failure is silent and destructive: read a normal
send as an edit and the turn deletes the conversation it was appending to.
