"""Guards the chat turn graph: what it asks, when it hands off, and what it emits.

TWO THINGS ARE LOAD-BEARING HERE.

First, `is_profile_complete()` is the only thing allowed to decide the turn is
ready to build. The router calls a model, but only ever to pick which of several
already-known-missing items to raise next. If that boundary ever slips — if the
model's answer can shorten intake or trigger a build — a hallucination stops
costing an awkward question and starts costing a build recommended against a
profile the user never stated.

Second, the SSE event vocabulary. Three callers and the frontend consume
run_chat_turn's events positionally and by name; the graph rewrite was supposed
to be invisible to all of them. The end-to-end tests below assert the exact
sequence, because "the graph still works" and "the browser still renders" are
different claims.

No network: every LLM call is stubbed, and the graph runs on an in-memory
checkpointer.
